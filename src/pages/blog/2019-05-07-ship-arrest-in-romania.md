1. Please give an overview of ship arrest practice in your country. Conditions imposed by Romanian law:

a) Indicate and provide evidences to the Court that plaintiffs have started the main legal action (Court

action or arbitration proceedings according to the provisions of the C/P or B/L) against the defendant.

The evidence should be a letter from a Court, apostilled according to Hague Convention 1961 or a letter

from the arbitrator appointed showing that arbitration has started;



 

b) Indicate and provide evidences to the Court that the defendant in the main proceedings is the owner of

the vessel;



 

c) Provide a bank letter of guarantee to the Court as a percentage of the claimed amount (the amount will be fixed by the Court but in most of the cases is 10%). In accordance with the new Civil Procedural Code which entered into force on 15th of February 2013, the amount of the guarantee should be placed in cash and is limited at 20% of the claimed amount.In cases where no written evidences concerning the relations between the creditor and the debtor are presented to the judge, the amount of the guarantee will be fixed at 50% of the claimed amount. The main purpose of such bank letter of guarantee is to compensate the losses of the defendant owner if finally the claim of the plaintiff will be found ungrounded by the Court.

In case the matter is very urgent, vessels can be provisionally arrested through the Harbor Master, paying a tax of Euro 400 (Saturdays and Sundays Euro 800).

A notice of arrest will be notified to the Harbor Master.

Harbor Master will place the order of arrest to the vessel’s file and will not interrupt in any way vessel’s operations. Notice of arrest will become effective when the vessel will finalize operations and vessel’s agent will attend Harbor Master to receive vessel’s permit to leave outside. Starting with the hour when vessel’s agent will ask for the Permit to leave, Harbor Master will count 24 hours (Saturdays and Sundays are not included within this hours anyway) and the vessel will be arrested for 24 hours. During these 24 hours, plaintiff will need to apply to the Court asking for the arrest of the vessel. Courts are judging these cases on an urgent basis and normally are issuing the decision within 24 hrs. There is no need for the time being to place the counter-security which will be requested by the Court at a later stage.

Court costs are low. Lawyer fees normally calculated on hourly basis Costs are usually recoverable from defendant.
